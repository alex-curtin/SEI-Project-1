# SEI-Project-1
Name: Chord Frenzy

API: The project will use the Uberchord API to get notes for a particular chord or chords.

MVP: At a minimum, the app should be able to take two parameters, the root note and the type of chord, and return a visual representation of at least one fingering variation of the chord for guitar. This will require two dropdown menus and a search button. Submitting a search will create an image (or images) of the chord on the bottom of the screen using CSS.

Strech: Stretch goals would include: displaying multiple variations for each chord, enabling users to save a list of chords they want to use, suggesting chords to go with the user's saved chords (this may require an additional API).
